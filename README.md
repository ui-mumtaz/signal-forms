# Dynamic Form Builder (Angular Material)

A drag-and-drop form designer built with Angular standalone components, signals,
Angular Material and the CDK, modelled on the "Angular Material Forms Designer"
Developed by Mumtaz Ahmad.


## Features

- **Field palette**: text, email, number, text area, dropdown, radio group,
  checkbox, toggle and date picker. Drag a field onto the form, or click it to
  append it to the last row.
- **Rows and columns**: each row holds several fields side by side. Drag fields
  within a row or between rows, reorder rows by their handle, add and delete rows.
- **Field settings panel**: label, form control name, placeholder, hint, rows
  (text area), options (dropdown and radio) and validation (required, min/max
  length, min/max value, regex pattern).
- **Live preview**: a real Signal Forms (`@angular/forms/signals`) form with
  validation messages and the submitted value.
- **Code export**: generates a standalone Angular Material component
  (HTML, TypeScript, SCSS) using Signal Forms, plus the JSON schema. Copy or
  download each file.
- **Import / persistence**: load a form from a JSON schema
  (try [`sample-form.json`](sample-form.json)); the current form is saved in
  the browser's local storage.

## Run it

Requires Node.js 20.19+ or 22.12+.

```bash
npm install
npm start          # http://localhost:4200
npm run build      # production build in dist/
```

`.npmrc` sets `legacy-peer-deps=true` because some npm 10 versions fail to
resolve the test tooling's peer dependencies otherwise.
